== Graph RAG Pipeline Implementation

The Graph RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline is implemented to enhance the chatbot's responses by integrating data from a Neo4j graph database with a Hugging Face model. The pipeline consists of the following steps:

1. *Database Querying*:
    - The Neo4j database is queried using Cypher queries to retrieve relevant information about patients, their conditions, hormone levels, and risk factors.
    - The query is loaded from a file and executed using the `query_database` function in the `pipeline.py` file.

2. *Response Generation*:
    - Predefined responses are used for common queries.
    - For more complex queries, the retrieved database information is combined with a prompt and passed to the Hugging Face model to generate a response.
    - The `generate_response` function handles the logic for determining whether to use a predefined response or generate a new one using the model.

3. *Model Integration*:
    - The Hugging Face GPT-2 model is used for text generation.
    - The model is loaded using the `pipeline` function from the `transformers` library.
    - The `generate_model_response` function constructs a prompt with the user query and database information, and generates a response using the model.

== Frontend and Backend Development Process

=== Backend Development

1. *FastAPI Setup*:
    - The backend is built using FastAPI, a modern web framework for building APIs with Python.
    - The FastAPI server is initialized in the `api.py` file, and CORS middleware is added to allow communication with the frontend.

2. *Endpoints*:
    - A single endpoint `/ask` is defined to handle user queries.
    - The endpoint receives a query, processes it using the `generate_response` function, and returns the generated response.

3. *Database Integration*:
    - The Neo4j database is configured using environment variables stored in a `.env` file.
    - The database connection is established using the `GraphDatabase` driver from the `neo4j` library.

=== Frontend Development

1. *React Setup*:
    - The frontend is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
    - The project is bootstrapped with Create React App.

2. *Components*:
    - The main component is the `App` component, defined in the `App.js` file.
    - The `App` component handles user input, displays messages, and communicates with the backend.

3. *Styling*:
    - The application is styled using CSS, with styles defined in the `App.css` file.
    - The design includes a chat interface with user and bot messages, an input field, and a send button.

== Prompt Engineering Techniques Used

1. *Predefined Responses*:
    - Common queries are matched against a set of predefined responses to provide quick and accurate answers.

2. *Dynamic Prompt Construction*:
    - For more complex queries, a prompt is dynamically constructed by combining the user query with relevant database information.
    - This prompt is then passed to the Hugging Face model to generate a contextually relevant response.

3. *Temperature and Token Control*:
    - The model's response generation is controlled using parameters like `max_new_tokens` and `temperature` to balance creativity and coherence.

== Challenges Encountered and How They Were Addressed

1. *Database Integration*:
    - Challenge: Ensuring efficient and accurate retrieval of data from the Neo4j database.
    - Solution: Optimized Cypher queries and used the `GraphDatabase` driver to manage connections and sessions effectively.

2. *Model Response Quality*:
    - Challenge: Generating coherent and contextually relevant responses from the Hugging Face model.
    - Solution: Fine-tuned the prompt engineering techniques and adjusted model parameters to improve response quality.

3. *Frontend-Backend Communication*:
    - Challenge: Handling asynchronous communication between the React frontend and FastAPI backend.
    - Solution: Used the `axios` library for making HTTP requests and managed state effectively in the React components.
