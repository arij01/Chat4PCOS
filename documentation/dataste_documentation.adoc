== Knowledge Graph Design

=== Purpose
The goal of the knowledge graph is to represent the complex relationships between patients, their health conditions, hormone measurements, and risk factors. This graph-based representation aids in querying the data for insights and understanding correlations between various attributes.

=== Entities and Relationships

==== Entities

1. *Patient*:
   Represents an individual patient. Contains attributes:
   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `Age`
   - `Weight`
   - `Height`
   - `BMI` (calculated from weight and height)

2. *Condition*:
   Represents clinical attributes related to PCOS diagnosis:
   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `patient_id` (Foreign Key linking to Patient)
   - `PCOS_YN` (indicating presence/absence of PCOS)
   - `Cycle_RI` (Cycle regularity/irregularity)
   - `Cycle_length_days`

3. *Hormone*:
   Represents hormone measurements and calculated ratios:
   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `patient_id` (Foreign Key linking to Patient)
   - `FSH_mIU_mL`
   - `LH_mIU_mL`
   - `FSH_LH` (calculated as FSH/LH ratio)
   - `AMH_ng_mL`
   - `TSH_mIU_L`

4. *RiskFactor*:
   Represents lifestyle and physical risk indicators:
   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `patient_id` (Foreign Key linking to Patient)
   - `Weight_gain_YN`, `Hair_growth_YN`, `Skin_darkening_YN`, `Pimples_YN`
   - `Fast_food_YN`, `Reg_Exercise_YN`

==== Relationships

* `PATIENT_HAS_CONDITION`: Links a `Patient` node to their `Condition` node.
* `PATIENT_HAS_MEASUREMENT`: Links a `Patient` node to their `Hormone` node.
* `PATIENT_HAS_RISK`: Links a `Patient` node to their `RiskFactor` node.

== Knowledge Graph Creation Process

=== Step 1: Data Preparation
* The dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values, remove redundant columns, and ensure consistency.
* BMI was calculated using the formula: \[BMI = \frac{Weight (kg)}{Height (m)^2}\].
* The FSH/LH ratio was derived by dividing FSH levels by LH levels.

=== Step 2: Graph Schema Definition
The graph schema was designed to capture the relationships between patients, their conditions, hormones, and risk factors. This schema emphasizes modularity and scalability, enabling future extensions.

=== Step 3: Node and Relationship Creation
Nodes and relationships were generated from the dataset using Cypher queries. For each record in the dataset:

* A `Patient` node was created with unique identifiers and demographic attributes.
* Associated `Condition`, `Hormone`, and `RiskFactor` nodes were created, linked back to the `Patient` node using relationships.

=== Step 4: Query Optimization
Indexes were created on the `id` and `patient_id` properties to enhance the performance of queries on the graph.

== Example Use Cases

1. *Identify high-risk patients*:
   Query patients with `PCOS_YN = 1` and multiple risk factors (e.g., `Weight_gain_YN = 1` and `Fast_food_YN = 1`).

2. *Analyze hormone patterns*:
   Find correlations between FSH/LH ratio and the presence of PCOS.

3. *Assess lifestyle impact*:
   Compare patients with regular exercise (`Reg_Exercise_YN = 1`) to those without.
